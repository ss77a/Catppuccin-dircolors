    A delicate pastle theme that injects catppucin flavours into your shell without overwhelming your workspace.<br>
    macOS friendly ï£¿
  </p>
  <p class="work-in-progress">
    To achieve this I am going to delve deep into this and that. This will be working with catppuccin cli -- using a .catppuccin.yaml. So the flavours themselves can be modified to suit your taste.
    I am hoping to make this work with another fork of joshjon to to the same to zsh and make a nice prompt too all using .catppucin.yaml. This project may well be on pause for sometime. This will also require cargo vivid :)

## About

Catppuccin dircolors is a theme for the ls command in macOS and Linux, and is made for use with dark theme terminals supporting 256 colors e.g. iTerm2.

The idea is to achieve a blissful haromony that shows colorized information. Making it easy to glance at system output. Making workflow a calm and tranquil process, whilst maintaining readability and visual distinction between elements. The colors are from catppucin pallete and are easy to modify and build upon.

### Setting the Mood

Bliss looks even better with the following terminal setup:

- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
- [Bliss iTerm Theme](https://github.com/joshjon/bliss-iterm)
- [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- [Bliss Oh My Zsh Theme](https://github.com/joshjon/bliss-zsh)

### Color Properties

Bliss has similarities to most [default ls colors](https://askubuntu.com/questions/17299/what-do-the-different-colors-mean-in-ls) where possible; however, some colors differ from the default scheme in order to increase readability.

- Regular file: white
- Directory: pink, bold
- Symbolic link: green
- Symbolic link to nonexistent file: red background, white
- File that has setuid (u+s): red, underscore
- File that has setgid (g+s): bronze, underscore
- Pipe, socket, door: bronze background, white
- Block and character device: bronze, underscore
- Executable: white, bold
- Other writable (o+w) directory: blue, bold
- Sticky bit (+t) directory: blue background, white
- Sticky other writable (+t,o+w) directory: teal background, white
- Archive or compressed: lavender, bold
- Image file: yellow
- Audio file: lime-green
- Video file: orange
- Logs and backups: grey

## Installation

### Installing GNU coreutils (required for macOS only)

Bliss dircolors is configured using GNU coreutils; however, macOS does not use GNU by default. To use dircolors we are going to need to install GNU coreutils.

1.  Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a free and open-source package manager that simplifies the installation of software on macOS.

        /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

2.  Install GNU coreutils using Homebrew.

        brew install coreutils

3.  GNU ls, along with other GNU commands in common with [BSD](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/explaining-bsd/article.html) (macOS command line tools), will now be prefixed with a "g". To use GNU ls without the "g" prefix, add the following to your shell config file (`.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc):

        PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
        MANPATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH"
        alias ls="ls --color=always"

4.  Shell will now be setup to use GNU dircolors for ls.

### Installing Bliss dircolors

1.  Clone the Bliss dircolors repo to stay up to date or use the [download ZIP](https://github.com/joshjon/bliss-dircolors/archive/master.zip) option and unzip the files.
2.  Add the following to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` to use Bliss dircolors for all future shell sessions.

        eval `dircolors ~/<path-to-cloned-repo>/bliss.dircolors`

3.  Open a new terminal and you will notice that ls output will have a splash of color! ðŸŒˆ

### Zsh Additional Install Information

If you are using Z shell (Zsh), you may also find that tab completion does not use dircolors when displaying directories. This can make some directories with permissions very difficult to read e.g. other-writable (o+w) directories as seen in the screenshot below.
![session](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshjon/bliss-docs/master/bliss-dircolors/images/zsh-issue.png)
To enable Bliss dircolors for Zsh tab completion simply put the following line in your .zshrc file:

```
zstyle ':completion:*:default' list-colors ${(s.:.)LS_COLORS}
```

Tab completion will now use the color properties in `bliss.dircolors`

## Testing

`bliss-test.zip` contains the sample files shown in the screenshot at the beginning of this document. Once Bliss is installed, this can be used to test the color output from ls.

Note: some files will lose their properties after being cloned to your machine. These properties will need to be re-applied accordingly for dircolors to take effect.

## Troubleshooting

### 'command not found: dircolors' (macOS)

Your coreutils PATH and MANPATH is incorrect and most likely due to a coreutils symlink not created at `/usr/local/opt/coreutils/` upon install.

By default, Homebrew will install all packages at `/usr/local/Cellar/` in all versions of macOS. Therefore, we can set PATH and MANPATH to the following:

```
PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/coreutils/<your-coreutils-version>/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
MANPATH="/usr/local/Cellar/coreutils/<your-coreutils-version>/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH"
```

If the issue is still not resolved, locate the coreutils `/gnubin` and `/gnuman` paths on your machine and set PATH and MANPATH accordingly.

### Zsh commands are not using Bliss dircolors

Refer to [Zsh Additional Install Information](#zsh-additional-install-information).
